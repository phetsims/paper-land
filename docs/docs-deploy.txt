Our documentation uses Mkdocs and is statically deployed with a pre-configure plugin for Mkdocs to GitHub Pages.
The built website is created on the gh-pages branch

mkdocs.yml is a required file and sets up the navigation tree and theme for the website.

.readthedocs.yaml is not required to deploy using the steps below. However, it does provide 
an alternative way for continuous deployment configured and freely hosted by Read The Docs. For now, we have not
gone this route, but it's set up to do so. The plan is to use GitHub Actions once it's configured to deploy automatically every push/pull request.

To deploy to the documentation website from a local machine (same steps GitHub Actions needs to do):
- Install Python (3.11 last supported at deploy)
- Install module requirements using `pip install`. Install using the requirements.txt file in this directory.
- run `mkdocs serve` to locally host the directory and preview changes in real time.
- When ready, run `mkdocs gh-deploy` and it will automatically build and push to the gh-pages branch and kick off GitHub Pages to run a deploy Action.
