# Camera Parameters optimization: 

You are looking for dots to be stably detected and might need to iteratively switch between this and calibration.

- TURN OFF Auto on: Zoom, Exposure, White Balance
- Adjust Exposure to see papers clearly (not too dark)
- Adjust: Zoom (clearest text)
- Adjust White Balance (make sure blacks look black, and not blue or green)
- (optional) Adjust contrast (can probably go to max)
- (optional) Raise Sharpness if edges look fuzzy

## Calibrate dots 
1. In the [Camera view](http://localhost:3000/camera.html), open the sidebar section labeled Calibrate. 
2. Select a dot color. The circle should show a white outline when in calibration mode for that color. 
3. Select the corresponding color in the Camera Viewport to calibrate that color. 
4. Repeat for all colors.
5. Decide if you need to make anymore camera parameter changes.

> Note about Markers: This sets the average size in addition to the color of the dot. If using Markers, they will be recognized based on dots three times (3x) the size of the calibrated dot. Markers also use the same color calibration as the corresponding dot color.
