## Required Hardware for Paper Detection and Control

- **Computer**: Any desktop or laptop computer should work. Performance will increase with better computer specifications (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.). All major operating systems and browsers should also work, though most testing has been done with Windows/MacOS and Chrome/Firefox.
- **Webcam**: 720p is adequate, but be cautious with cameras having low-quality sensors, as they might not perform well under all lighting conditions. 1080p cameras are ideal for use when the camera cannot be close to the play area or paper dots are very small.
- **Color Printer**: Alternatively, a black and white printer with coloring markers will do. Check [Resources](../use/resources.md) for templates.
  - A simple piece of paper and a steady hand can also be effective!
  - Try colored stickers too!

## Required Hardware for Projector Use

- **Projector**: Ideally, at least 2000 lumens. A 1000 lumens projector might suffice in certain conditions, but the dim light required for projections might be too dark for your camera to detect programs.
- **Projector Mount**: If your projector is large, ensure the projector is secured to a load-bearing structure like a beam or stud. Command Strips or screws in drywall may not suffice. Note: You can project onto a wall and tape your programs there for a vertical setup. It is also possible to [use mirrors for an optical trick]()!
- **Optional**: Depending on your setup, you might need extension cables for your video (VGA, HDMI, DisplayPort, etc) and USB cables to connect the camera and projector to the computer.
- **Optional**: A solid black rug or mat for projection. Note: a projector's brightness is limited by its bulb, and its darkness is determined by the surface it projects onto.
