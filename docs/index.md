## Augmented Reality Meets Multimodal Web Design

Paper Playground is an open-source tool for collaboratively designing multimodal web interactions by mapping JavaScript code to real pieces of paper and manipulating them in your physical space. It is based on the [Paper Programs](https://paperprograms.org) open-source project and has been extended to incorporate the API used by [PhET Interactive Simulations](https://www.github.com/phetsims/). The tool focuses on enabling quick prototyping of web projects using JavaScript, with a particular emphasis on easy addition of audio features (like sounds and sonifications), speech description (both TTS engines and screen reader descriptions), and other non-visual features that are often difficult to design and develop alongside visual elements in these projects.

The primary purpose of Paper Playground is to enable expert developers and designers to rapidly iterate on stakeholder's ideas, especially when co-designing with non-technical stakeholders who have valuable feedback but no expertise to implement their ideas in real-time. By using Paper Playground, developers and designers can create inclusive and joyful web experiences by seamlessly weaving visuals, sounds, spoken descriptions, and other inputs and displays.

## What can you do with it?

This repository is dedicated to retaining the features of [Paper Programs](https://paperprograms.org). For the most accurate documentation regarding legacy features (*including writing code for output to Projector*), refer to the [wonderful Paper Programs documentation](https://github.com/janpaul123/paperprograms/blob/master/docs/).



### What do I do now? How do I create programs, detect programs, set up my camera and space, and make things happen?

For detailed answers to these questions and more helpful information on creating papers and delightful multimodal web experiences, please refer to our [Paper Playground Docs](https://phetsims.github.io/paper-land).
