Paper Playground is an open-source project for collaboratively creating multimodal web experiences by means of mapping code to real pieces of paper and manipulating the code in your **physical space**. Everything runs on your machine and you can collaborate locally or using a hosting service to collaborate over projects with others in your shared space.

While Paper Playground can support many uses, our aim to support a community interested in bringing physical interaction as a means to collaboratively solve problems in codesigning technology.

Paper Playground is based on the [Paper Programs](https://paperprograms.org) open-source project and has been extended to incorporate [SceneryStack](https://github.com/scenerystack), the development stack used by [PhET Interactive Simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu) as a robust 2D scene renderer and support for multimodal features. The project focuses on enabling quick prototyping of web projects based in JavaScript. In creating Paper Playground, we are developing with a particular emphasis on easy addition of multimodal display such as audio features (like sounds and sonifications), speech description (both TTS engines and screen reader descriptions), and other non-visual features that are often difficult to design and develop alongside visual elements in complex web projects. Learn more on the [Multimodal Codesign page](./projects/codesign.md).

### Overview of Paper Playground Components

Paper Playground is built around a few key components that work together seamlessly:

- **Program Creation Systems**: Design and iterate on your programs with ease using abstracted program components in *Creator*.
- **Computer Vision**: Our tool detects your dot-encoded paper programs using a webcam, merging the digital and physical realms.
- **Execution and Display**: See your code come to life on screen while you manipulate it with your hands, with outputs displayed in real-time.
- **Collaboration**: Shared databases enable synchronous and asynchronous collaboration, whether you‚Äôre working locally or online.

You‚Äôll interact with Paper Playground through three main interfaces:

1. ***Camera***: Detects your paper programs using an attached camera device.
2. ***Interactive Display***: Shows the results of your programs, which can be interacted with virtually or projected.
3. ***Creator***: A low-code interface where you design your programs, step by step.
