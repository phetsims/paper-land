# Features Wishlist

## Documentation
- Thorough API documentation for PhET libraries

## Code Abstraction
- Reduce boilerplate
- Interface for creating paper programs using components [CURRENT DEV FOCUS]
   - Code abstraction of PhET Libraries 

## Program Detection (OpenCV)
- Additional dot colors (increase max program number per database)
- Custom dot colors
- Improve base performance
- Automatic calibration
- Optional Alternatives for detection:
  - Aruco Markers \[beholder\](  <ins>https://github.com/project-beholder/beholder-detection</ins>)

## Virtual "Preview" Program Features
- Reference marks on virtual papers in Camera overlay that make it easier to line them up relative to each other
- Whiskers drawn on Camera overlay
- Making the virtual paper manipulation embodied by harnessing computervision hand tracking/gesture support (e.g., MediaPipe).

## Camera Control
- Exposure control (Automatic Exposure Adjustment)
- White Balance control (Automatic White Balance Adjustment)
- Focus control (automatic focus adjustment)

## Interface and Database Interaction:
- Delay the sending of the DELETE query to the database for 5 seconds and allow user to press an UNDO button that appears or swaps with the Delete button. Would need some additional design, but might be nicer from the UX side and program security.
- Overhaul Spaces and make it easier to copy programs
