# Paper Land Implementation Notes

## Board Console
From program code you can use functions like
phet.paperLand.console.log( string )
phet.paperLand.console.warn( string )
phet.paperLand.console.error( message )

and messages will appear in the box and in dev tools.

New messages appear at the bottom of the box and it will auto scroll with new messages unless the user has scrolled up.

The console can be hidden/shown with a checkbox in the board controls panel.
