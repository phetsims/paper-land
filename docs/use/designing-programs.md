# How to design the project and paper programs you want!

Designing your interactive project should start from as simple and high-level as you can. For example, I want to create a virtual guitar that I can strum and play different chords.

Questions to ask:

1. What information do I need for my interactive?
2. What things need to change?
3. What verbs are you trying to accomplish with your project?


There are many great resources on game design that can assist you on your way from idea to working prototype!

Some of the hardest questions will require mapping your ideas to JavaScript components such as data structures, events, and conditional and/or looping structures.

Creating an interactive multimodal web project using an abstracted component interface is an interesting approach. Here are some guidelines and recommended steps for a novice user to consider when designing and implementing their project:

**1. Define Project Goals:**
   - What is the main purpose of your project?
   - What experience do you want users to have?
   - What problem or need does your project address?

**2. Identify Target Audience:**
   - Who is your intended audience?
   - What are their needs and preferences?
   - How can your project cater to their interests?

**3. Design Considerations:**
   - How will users interact with your project (voice commands, gestures, clicks, etc.)?
   - How will the different components interact with each other?
   - How will you ensure a consistent user experience across different devices and platforms?
   - How will you handle accessibility and inclusivity?

**4. Content Planning:**
   - What kind of content (text, images, videos, etc.) will your project include?
   - How will you structure and organize the content?
   - How will you ensure that the content is engaging and informative?

**5. Abstracted Component Interface:**
   - What components will your interface include? (buttons, cards, modals, etc.)
   - How will these components interact with user inputs and each other?
   - How will you abstract the behavior and appearance of these components?

**6. User Flow and Navigation:**
   - How will users navigate through your project?
   - What paths will users take to achieve different goals?
   - How will you guide users through the interface effectively?

**7. Prototype and Wireframing:**
   - Create rough sketches or digital wireframes of your project's layout and interactions.
   - Test your wireframes with potential users to gather feedback early in the process.

**8. Technology and Tools:**
   - What tools will you use to create and manage your project? (design software, prototyping tools, collaboration platforms, etc.)

**9. Accessibility and Inclusivity:**
   - How will you ensure that your project is usable by individuals with disabilities?
   - Are you following accessibility guidelines such as WCAG?

**10. Testing and Iteration:**
   - Regularly test your project's components and interactions.
   - Gather feedback from users and make necessary improvements.
   - Test your project on different devices and browsers.

**11. Deployment and Hosting:**
   - How will you host and deploy your project online?
   - Choose a reliable hosting platform and configure your project for production.

**12. Documentation and Support:**
   - Provide clear documentation on how to use your project.
   - Consider including a help section or contact information for user support.

**13. Privacy and Security:**
   - How will you handle user data and privacy concerns?
   - Implement security measures to protect user information.

**14. User Feedback:**
   - Create a mechanism for users to provide feedback and suggestions.
   - Use this feedback to continually improve your project.

**15. Continuous Learning:**
   - Stay updated with the latest design trends and technologies.
   - Learn from other interactive projects and seek inspiration.

Remember that creating an interactive multimodal web project is a process that involves creativity, design thinking, and user-centered considerations. Take your time, iterate, and be open to learning and adapting as you go along.
