## Paper Program Blank Template

Don't have a color printer, but do have markers/colored pencils? Use this template to fill in the color dot sequences for your paper programs on the fly.

!!! info "Advice"
        
        Try to color in the dots as uniformly as possible to improve detection by your camera.
