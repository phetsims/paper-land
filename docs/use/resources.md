## Paper Program Blank Template

    Try to color in the dots as uniformly as possible to improve detection by your camera.

!!! tip
    Dot sequences are tied to the program number/ID. When using Creator, you can change the number of the programs you create. This means that you can re-use papers over and over! Just note the number of the paper you have printed and change the program numbers before sending them to the Playground.
